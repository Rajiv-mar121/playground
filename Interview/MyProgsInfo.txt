Floyd Cycle Detection algorithm

Types Of ThreadPool:
===========================
 1) Single Thread Executor : A thread pool with only one thread.
  So all the submitted tasks will be executed sequentially. Method : Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor()
 
 2) Cached Thread Pool : A thread pool that creates as many threads it needs to execute the task in parrallel. 
 The old available threads will be reused for the new tasks. If a thread is not used during 60 seconds, 
 it will be terminated and removed from the pool. Method : Executors.newCachedThreadPool()
 
 3) Fixed Thread Pool : A thread pool with a fixed number of threads. If a thread is not available for the task,
  the task is put in queue waiting for an other task to ends. Method : Executors.newFixedThreadPool()
  
 4) Scheduled Thread Pool : A thread pool made to schedule future task. Method : Executors.newScheduledThreadPool()
  
 5) Single Thread Scheduled Pool : A thread pool with only one thread to schedule future task. Method : Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor()
 
 
 
 ==========================
 a) Concurrent hash map working (imp)
 Divided into 16 parts, Since update operations like put(), remove(), putAll() or clear() is not synchronized,

 b) cyclic barrier and conuntdown latch

 CyclicBarrier: http://javarevisited.blogspot.in/2012/07/cyclicbarrier-example-java-5-concurrency-tutorial.html
	 1) You can not reuse CountDownLatch once count is reaches to zero, this is the main difference 
	 between CountDownLatch and CyclicBarrier, which is frequently asked in core Java interviews and multi-threading  interviews.
	
	 2) Main Thread wait on Latch by calling CountDownLatch.await() method while other thread calls 
	 CountDownLatch.countDown() to inform that they have completed.
